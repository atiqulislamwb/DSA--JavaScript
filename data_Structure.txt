Data structure----> Data Structures are collections of values , the relationship
among them,and the function or operations that can be applied to the data...

//different data structure need to solve different problems

**Working with map/location ---> graph structure
**Working with fast inserts/removal at the beginning and end---> linked list structure
**Working with scraping web data in HTML ---> tree structure
**Write a Scheduler ---> binary heap structure
